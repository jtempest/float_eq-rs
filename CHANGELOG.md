The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.1] - 2022-10-12

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where field visibility was not respected when deriving the Ulps
  type.
  - https://github.com/jtempest/float_eq-rs/issues/24
- Fixed documentation to refer to `ComplexUlps32` rather than the incorrect
  `Complex32Ulps`.
  - https://github.com/jtempest/float_eq-rs/issues/23

## [1.0.0] - 2022-06-02
Added some resource links to the documentation and promoted the crate to
release version 1.0.0, as it has been stable for some time now.

## [0.7.0] - 2021-10-03
Bumped up the version number since this release includes breaking API changes.

### Changed
- Derived types no longer have a default set of derived traits, use the newly
  added `ulps_tol_derive` and `debug_ulps_diff_derive` options to `#[float_eq]`
  to provide a list of traits to be derived instead.
- The "derive" feature no longer requires the "full" feature from `syn`.
- Separated out and clarified the documentation for implementing the various
  extension traits.

## [0.6.1] - 2021-07-31

### Changed
- Clearer documentation for the `FloatEqDebugUlpsDiff` and `FloatEqUlpsTol`
  traits.
- Updated derive tests to match current compiler output.
- Switched to using github actions and codecov.io for continuous integration
  and coverage.

## [0.6.0] - 2021-05-03
Bumped up the version number since this release includes breaking API changes.

### Changed
- Renamed many ambiguous uses of epsilon/eps/max_diff to tolerance/tol, which is
  the mathematical term of art.
- Implementation of traits for arrays of any size using const generics.
- Updated `num-complex` dependency to 0.4.
- Reworked the documentation, added a tutorial.

### Fixed
- Safer behaviour when initialising debug output for array trait impls,
  including the removal of a source of undefined behaviour.

## [0.5.0] - 2020-08-24
Bumped up the version number since this release includes breaking API changes
to the extension traits.

### Changed
- Renamed `FloatEqDebug` to `AssertFloatEq`, and similarly `FloatEqAllDebug` to 
  `AssertFloatEqAll`. This is to provide a more obvious link between these
  traits and the assert capability. The `FloatDiff` trait has been folded into
  `AssertFloatEq` both for clarity and because it is geared towards debug
  context and was not as general as the name implied.
- Expanded `rel` checks into `rmax` (aka `rel`), `rmin`, `r1st` and `r2nd` to
  select which operand to scale epsilon's granularity to.
- Significant rewrite of the documentation to clarify aspects of comparison and
  to have a slightly more streamlined structure with better defined sections.
- Updated `num-complex` dependency to 0.3.

## [0.4.1] - 2020-06-22

### Added
- The `derive_float_eq` helper macro to simplify deriving traits.

### Fixed
- Update README usage documentation to the correct version, correctly documented
  the "num" feature.

## [0.4.0] - 2020-06-19
Bumped up the version number since this release includes breaking API changes.

### Added
- `#[derive]` support for all traits on tuple structs and structs with named
  fields.
- The `FloatUlps` trait, which is a way to syntactically tie a floating point
  type to its ULPs representation. The prefered way to express this is now to
  implement `FloatUlps for T` and then use `Ulps<T>` for the ULPs type. The
  other traits have been reworked to reflect this.
- Blanket trait impls for comparing slices, Option, Vec, VecDeque, LinkedList,
  BTreeMap and HashMap.

### Changed
- Blanket array impls now allow for comparison of arrays of different types.
- `FloatEqAll::Epsilon` is now `AllEpsilon` and `FloatEqAllDebug::DebugEpsilon`
  is now `AllDebugEpsilon` to help avoid ambiguity.

## [0.3.1] 2020-06-03

### Added
- Blanket trait impls for comparing mutable and immutable reference types and
  the contents of Cell, RefCell, Rc, Arc and Box instances.
- More descriptive documentation for combining types of check.

## [0.3.0] - 2020-05-30
Bumped up the version number since this release includes breaking API changes.

### Added
- The `FloatEqAll` and `FloatEqAllDebug` traits, which allow for `abs_all`,
  `rel_all` and `ulps_all` to be used in the `float_eq` and `assert_float_eq`
  families of macros, which take a single epsilon value to be applied uniformly
  across all fields being compared. The behaviour of `FloatEq` has now changed
  to apply epsilon values structurally, on a per-field basis, since that is a
  more general behaviour (e.g. all tuples may sensibly be `FloatEq` but not
  `FloatEqAll`). If existing checks against arrays or `num::Complex` break, 
  switching to use the `_all` variants ought to fix them.
- Support for tuples of up to size 12 (inclusive).
- Documentation on how to interpret assert error messages.

### Changed
- ULPs checks now treat `NaN` values as not equal, to match the default partial
  equality behaviour of floats.
- Equality of infinities is now consistent, both internally and with respect to
  general IEEE floating point behaviour.
- `FloatEq` now more specifically means equality based on a structurally defined
  epsilon type. See the notes on `FloatEqAll` above.
- `FloatDiff` is much more rigorously defined, in particular `ulps_diff` now
  returns `Option<T>`, see the API documentation for details.
- `FloatEq`'s `DiffEpsilon` is now `Epsilon`, and `UlpsDiffEpsilon` is now
  `UlpsTol`. This reduces visual noise around the usage and harmonizes the
  naming with `FloatEqDebug`'s associated types.
- Directed docs.rs to build documentation for all features.

## [0.2.0] - 2020-04-12
Bumped up the version number since this release includes breaking API changes.

### Added
- Implementation of traits for arrays of size 0 to 32 (inclusive) where the type
  allows it. Epsilon is assumed to be uniform across the array being compared.
- The 'num' feature, which when enabled provides support for comparison of
  `num::Complex` instances.
- Documentation to help with implementing the traits.

### Changed
- `FloatDiff`, `FloatEq` and `FloatEqDebug` along with the macros that use them 
  now allow for a different `Rhs` type to be specified instead of assuming it is
  always `Self`.
- The somewhat awkward `FloatEq::rel_epsilon` was removed in favour of a more 
  equitable `FloatEqDebug` trait for displaying debug information. 
- Asserts now correctly dereference parameters.
- Somewhat more streamlined assert error messages that allow for easier direct
  comparison of diffs and epsilons.
- Switched back to being 'experimental' on crates.io since the API might change
  a lot in the next few versions.

## [0.1.3] - 2020-04-07
### Added
- Added codecov.io and coveralls.io support.
- Added 'actively-developed' maintenance badge.
- Basic usage documentation.

## [0.1.2] - 2020-04-07
### Added
- Support for `no_std`.
- Added the crate to the No Standard Library crates.io category.
- Tests for `Float::abs_diff` on NaNs.
- Travis CI build.
- A Contributing section to the readme.

### Fixed
- FloatDiff tests for f64 no longer test f32 values (oops!).

## [0.1.1] - 2020-04-05
### Added
- Added this changelog.
- Reworked the READMEs to be a bit more granular and provide more appropriate 
  information.
    - The API documentation `lib.rs` has been pared down a bit and several 
      sections moved to other places.
    - `crates-io.md` contains a short project introduction, links to alternative
      crates and future plans.
    - `README.md` is generated from `crates-io.md` and `LICENSE.md`. 
- Updated Cargo.toml:
    - Included a link to the documentation.
    - Added the crate to the Development Tools (Debugging) category.

## [0.1.0] - 2020-04-05
